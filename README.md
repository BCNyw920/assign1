cs4843 assignment 1 respository for the s3 and cloudfront website

My website used the S3 infrastructure to host the static website with cloudfront accessing cached website pages for its content delivery service with IAM policies. The process of setting up the website was as described and demonstrated in class sessions and the online lecture videos. The website is static, being hosted through a bucket in S3 with all files being in the bucket which is then backed with cloudfront for faster content delivery. The webpage files are simple with 1 index webpage which includes buttons to reach the other webpages, 1 video webpage, 1 image webpage, 1 webpage with my information, and 1 error webpage.
